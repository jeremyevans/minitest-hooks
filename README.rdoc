= minitest-hooks

minitest-hooks adds around and before_all/after_all/around_all hooks for Minitest.
This allows you do things like run each suite of specs inside a database transaction,
running each spec inside its own savepoint inside that transaction, which can
significantly speed up testing for specs that share expensive database setup code.

= Installation

  gem install minitest-hooks

= Source Code

Source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-hooks

= Usage 

== In Specs (Minitest::Spec)

=== For all specs

  require 'minitest/hooks/default'

=== For some specs

First, you need to require the library.

  require 'minitest/hooks'

You can set the default for some specs to be <tt>Minitest::HooksSpec</tt>:

  MiniTest::Spec.register_spec_type(/something/, Minitest::HooksSpec)

Alternatively, you can include <tt>Minitest::Hooks</tt> in a specific spec class:

  describe 'something' do
    include Minitest::Hooks
  end

=== before_all Hooks

To run code before any specs in the suite are executed, pass +:all+ to +before+:

  describe 'something' do
    before(:all) do
      DB[:table].insert(:column=>1)
    end
  end

=== after_all Hooks

To run code after all specs in the suite are executed, pass +:all+ to +after+:

  describe 'something' do
    after(:all) do
      DB[:table].delete
    end
  end

=== around Hooks

To run code around each spec in a suite, call +around+ with a block, and have the block
call +super+:

  describe 'something' do
    around do |&block|
      DB.transaction(:rollback=>:always, :savepoint=>true, :auto_savepoint=>true) do
        super(&block)
      end
    end
  end

=== around_all Hooks

To run code around all specs in a suite, call <tt>around(:all)</tt> with a block,
and have the block call +super+:

  describe 'something' do
    around(:all) do |&block|
      DB.transaction(:rollback=>:always) do
        super(&block)
      end
    end
  end

=== In Tests (Minitest::Test)

Create a subclass of <tt>Minitest::Test</tt> and include <tt>Minitest::Hooks</tt>,
and have your test classes subclass from that subclass:

  require 'minitest/hooks/test'
  class MyTest < Minitest::Test
    include Minitest::Hooks
  end

  class TestSuite1 < MyTest
  end

You can just define the +before_all+, +after_all+, +around+, and +around_all+ methods,
instead of using the spec DSL.  Make sure to call super when overriding the methods.

  class TestSuite1 < MyTest
    def before_all
      super
      DB[:table].insert(:column=>1)
    end

    def after_all
      DB[:table].delete
      super
    end

    def around
      DB.transaction(:rollback=>:always, :savepoint=>true, :auto_savepoint=>true) do
        super
      end
    end

    def around_all
      DB.transaction(:rollback=>:always) do
        super
      end
    end
  end

= Behavior

== Hooks Just Define Methods

Just like the before/after hooks supported by minitest, all hooks supported by minitest-hooks
just define methods on the spec class, there is no magic ("It's just ruby").  This has a
couple of effects:

1. You cannot define multiple hooks of the same type in the same class.  This is because
   you cannot have multiple methods with the same name in the same class.  If you define
   a second hook of the same type in the same class, it will overwrite the previous hook,
   just like ruby's behavior if you define a method twice in the same class.

2. For around and around(:all) hooks, you should always call super.  If you want a subclass
   around hook to run inside a superclass around hook, you need to call super in the
   subclass hook and run the code inside the block you pass to super, then call block.call
   somewhere inside the super block:

     describe "superclass" do
       around do |&block|
         some_outer_method do
           super(&block)
         end
       end

       describe "subclass" do
         around do |&block|
           super do
             some_inner_method do
               block.call
             end
           end
         end
       end
     end

   You do not need to call super for before(:all) or after(:all) hooks. Both before(:all) and
   after(:all) implicitly call super for you in the method they define, mirroring minitest's
   behavior for before and after hooks.

3. All hooks share state/instance variables.  So any instance variables you set in before(:all),
   around(:all), or around are shared with the examples.  Note that after(:all) will only see
   instance variables set in before(:all) or around(:all), it will not see instance variables
   set inside examples.

== All Spec Classes are Independent

The way minitest works, all spec classes are indepedent of other spec classes in terms
of how and when they are executed, even spec classes that are subclasses of other spec
classes.  This means that for every spec class, the before(:all), after(:all), and
around(:all) hooks for that class will be executed, even if they were defined in the
spec's superclass and not in the spec class itself.

So if you have a spec superclass that uses before(:all), and a spec subclass for that
superclass, the before(:all) in the spec superclass will be run twice, once in the context
of an instance of the superclass, before executing the superclass's specs, and once in the
context of an instance of the subclass, before executing the subclass's specs.

== Order of Operations

For each spec class, the around(:all) hooks are run first.  Both before(:all) and after(:all)
run inside around(:all).  For each spec inside the spec the spec class, around will be called,
and before and after for each spec will be run inside around.
